# If you plan on using different AWS SDKs to access your RGW via S3 then a default and best practice way is to create a
# ~/.aws/credentials file. This way any AWS SDK can connect without having to update all of the code bases. Of course, you
# can pass in the access_key and secret_key values which will override the credentials file.

# This specific credentials file is for the admin log injection credentials
