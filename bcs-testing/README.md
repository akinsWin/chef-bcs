### BCS-Testing
bcs-testing.go is a golang code base that does perf tests on BCS for HTTP GET and POST.
To compile and run bcs-testing got to http://golang.org and download the GO package and install it.
Next, setup your .profile or .bash_profile file by appending the path to where you want to compile the
source. DO NOT do it in this directory! Do something like $HOME/projects/golang/bcs-testing.

You should now be able to compile it with go install bcs-testing/...
